# Customer Churn Analysis in Power BI
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using Power BI. The goal is to identify the main reasons why customers are leaving, understand key demographic and behavioral patterns of churned customers, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention. This analysis aims to help businesses understand their customer base better and proactively reduce churn.

## Project Goals

* Identify and quantify the overall customer churn rate.
* Uncover the primary reasons behind customer attrition.
* Analyze demographic (e.g., location) and behavioral (e.g., payment method, contract type, service usage) factors influencing churn.
* Develop actionable insights and recommendations for effective customer retention strategies.
* Create an interactive and professional Power BI dashboard for stakeholders to monitor churn trends.

## Data Source

* Customer dataset provided by DataCamp for case study analysis.
* The dataset typically includes customer demographics, service usage, contract details, payment information, and churn status.

## Tools Used

* **Power BI Desktop:** Utilized for robust data modeling, sophisticated DAX calculations, and intuitive dashboard visualization.
* **Power Query (M Language):** Employed for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, ensuring data quality and readiness.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Leveraged for creating complex calculated columns and measures, enabling deep analytical capabilities within the report.
## Key Analysis & Insights: Unpacking Our Churn Story

Our detailed analysis from the Power BI dashboard provides a compelling narrative, highlighting critical areas for strategic focus:

### The Current Landscape: Our Churn Snapshot

* **Significant Customer Loss:** We currently have **6,687 customers**, but **1,796 have churned**, resulting in a **26.9% churn rate**. This means nearly one in four customers is walking away, directly impacting our revenue.
* **Revenue at Risk:** Our recurring "Monthly Charge" is **$207.5K**. Every lost customer chips away at this vital income stream.

### Why They're Leaving: The Core Drivers of Churn

The data clearly points to specific reasons our customers are disengaging:

* **Competitor Pressure (Our Biggest Challenge):**
    * **Better Devices (28.67% of churn):** Our rivals offer more compelling hardware.
    * **Better Offers/More Data (26.25% & 10.62% of churn):** Competitors are winning on value and data plans.
    * ***Our Target:*** We must **re-evaluate our product offerings (especially devices) and pricing strategies** to aggressively counter competitor advantages.

* **Customer Service Issues:**
    * **Support Attitude (19.59% of churn):** Nearly one in five churning customers cite our support team's attitude.
    * ***Our Target:*** We need to **invest in targeted training for our customer service teams** to ensure consistently positive customer interactions.

### Who's Leaving & When: Behavioral & Contract Insights

Understanding specific customer groups helps us refine our approach:

* **Low Usage Customers Are High Risk:**
    * Customers using **"Less than 5 GB"** have the highest churn rate at **34.71%**.
    * ***Our Target:*** **Develop tailored value propositions or product tiers for low-usage customers** to make our service more appealing and prevent their departure.

* **The Early Churn Trap:**
    * We see a significant churn surge in the **initial 0-30 months** of a customer's journey (peaking at **62.10%** very early on). Long-term customers (beyond 60 months) are much stickier.
    * ***Our Target:*** **Fortify our onboarding process and early customer engagement** to reduce churn in the critical initial months.

* **Monthly Contracts Are Less Sticky:**
    * Most customers (55%) are on "Month-to-month" contracts, which inherently carry a higher churn risk compared to longer-term commitments.
    * ***Our Target:*** **Create strong incentives to encourage migration from monthly to yearly contracts**, building greater loyalty and stability.

### Where It's Happening: Geographic Hotspots

The "Churn Rate by State and Date" map highlights specific regions with disproportionately high churn.

* ***Our Target:*** **Utilize this geographic data to deploy targeted, localized retention campaigns or service improvements** where they are most needed.

## Strategic Imperatives: What We Must Do Now

These insights demand clear, decisive action. Our immediate priorities to significantly impact churn are:

1.  **Product & Competitive Edge:** **Deep dive into our device offerings and data plans to match or surpass competitors.**
2.  **Elevate Customer Service:** **Invest in training our support teams** to ensure consistently positive customer interactions.
3.  **Fortify Early Experience:** **Improve onboarding and early customer engagement** to reduce churn in the critical initial months.
4.  **Re-evaluate Low-Usage Value:** **Develop tailored offerings for low-usage customers** to boost their perceived value.
5.  **Targeted Geographic Campaigns:** **Focus retention efforts on high-churn regions identified on our map.**
## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive and professional Power BI dashboard has been developed to visualize the key metrics and insights from this analysis. It allows users to explore churn trends by various dimensions (demographics, payment methods, contract types, etc.) through dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities, empowering self-service data exploration.
